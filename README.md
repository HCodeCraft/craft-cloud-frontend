Craft Cloud Front end

Welcome to Craft Cloud!

A site to help you manage your current craft projects and crafting aspirations! This web app allows you to create craft categories and craft projects with any data you choose. Youâ€™re able to enter many details about the craft projects you add - name, image, link, description, difficulty, notes and completed. The app also allows you to edit and delete categories and crafts; those changes will be reflected in the Ruby/Active record backend. (https://github.com/HannaBear/Craft-Cloud-Backend). Both Categories and Crafts have full CRUD functionality.
